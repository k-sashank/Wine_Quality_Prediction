# Wine_Quality_Prediction
In this notebook, I have made a Wine Quality predictor using the Random Forest model. I have modified the wine quality value (which was given out of 10) to a categorical variable and it is marked as 'good' if it's quality score was >=6.5 and is marked as 'bad' if it's quality score was <6.5. I have also changed the Wine Type from string (white and red) to numerical (using LabelEncoder).
I could reach an accuracy of 85.1%.
